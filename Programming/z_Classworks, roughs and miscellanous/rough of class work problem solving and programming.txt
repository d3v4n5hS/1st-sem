Algorithm for Real life problem
Problem:
Heat up  A CAN OF SOUP

ALGORITHM:

1 OPEN CAN USING A CAN OPENER
2 POUR THE CONTENTS OF CAN INTO SAUCEPAN
3 PLACE SAUCEPAN ON THE RING OF COOKER
4 TURN ON CORRECT COOKER RING
5 STIR SOUP UNTIL WARM

MAY SEEM A BIT OF A SILLY EXAMPLE BUT IT SHOWS US HOW TO MAKE AN ALGORITHM
TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AND THE IMPORTANCWE OF THE ORDER OF STEPS



PROPERTIES OF ALGORITHM
Finiteness 
Must terminate after a finte number of steps.
Definitiveness
Action in each step to be carried out must be rigorously and unambiguously specified
Input
Has Zero or more inputs that are provided to it initially or dynamically.
Output 
Has one or  more inputs : quantities that have a specified



PATTERNS IN ALGORITHMS
Sequential 
Executes the statements in the order in which they appear in the algorithm
Selectional (Conditional)
Controls the flow of statements execution based on certain conditions.
Iterational (Loop)
Used when a part of the algorithm is to be executed multiple times
Recurtional
The functional computed by the algorithm are expressed in terms of itself.


SELECTIONAL ALGORITHMS (CONDITIONAL)
Examples:


Problem: To decide if a fire alarm shoul be sounded
ALGORITHM:
1 If fire is detected     (CONDITION)
2. Then sound fire alarm  (ACTION)

Another example is:-
PROBLEM: To decide whether or not to go to school
ALGORITHM:
1. IF it is a weekday AND itis not a holiday
2. THEM go to school
3. ELSE stay at home


Pass / Fail and average 

Write an algorithm to find rhte average marks of a student.
Also check whether the student has passed or failed. 
For a student to be declared pass, average marks should not be less than 65
Step 1 : Read Marks1, Marks2, Marks3
Step 2: Total = Marks1 + Marks2 + Marks3
Step 3: Average = Total / 3
Step : Set output = "passed"
Step 5: If Average =




Problem : Write an algorithm to find whether it is a leap year or not

Step 1: Read the number of days in year D
step 2: set year =" not leap"
step 3: If D= 366 then set year = "Leap"
step 4: Diaplay D

STEP 1:Read Year
STEP 2:IF (( year% 4 = 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (Year % 400=0))
             Display "Year is a leap year"
         Else 
             Display "Year is not a leap year"
       END IF



Algorithm for Iterative Problems
This type of loop keeps on carrying out a commans or commands UNTIL a command
is satisfied, the condition is given with the UNTIL command.

Iterational algothms

Find the average marks scored by N number of students

Read the Number of Students
let Counter = 1
Read maks1, marks2, marks3
Total = Marks1 + Marks2 + Marks3
average = Total /3 
Set Output = "student Passed"
if (average <65) then set output = "failed "
display output
counter = counter + 1
if (counter <= numberof students) then goto step 3g



Bigger Problems 

TOp Down Design 
Top Down Design uses the same method to break a programming problem down into manageable steps.

TOp down design for real Life problem
Problem: To repair a puncture on a bike wheel 
Algorithm:
1. remove the tyre 
   1.1 turn
