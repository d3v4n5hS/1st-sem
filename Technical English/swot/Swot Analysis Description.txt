Hello Everyone, My Name is Bimal parajuli. Currently from Kathmandu Nepal. 

I'd like to thank our teacher for providing me this opprtunity to introduce myself through my SWOT analysis.

I studied my high school from Kathmandu Model College and currently studying Computer Science And Engineering with Major in Data Science in VIT.

Talking about my strengths,
I am a creative and diligent and hardworking person. 

I am also a quite logical and rational person. 

I am very much interested in mathematics, PHYSICS esp. mechanics, electronics and computing.

I am also a very good self-learner and I love reading new books, journals and research papers in a variety of topics learning about new technolgy that emerge out regularly. 

I also have a sound knowledge in the field of electronics, programming and robotics.
I have participated in various national level robotics competitions and olympiads

I also have some leadership qualities and  fairly good problem solving skills as well.




Coming on to my weaknesses,

I am very weak at memorizing things like name of strangers, facts which are not backed by logics.

I am sometimes late and miss the deadlines because I try to make my projects perfect on every aspects.

Sometimes I even tend to procastinate which sets me back.

I also tend to give more time to extracurriculars than my curriculm due to which I often have to overwork ahead of my exam.




Now while talking about opportunities, being in VIT is in itself is a huge plus point for me which brings to me a plethora of opportunities.

I have the opportunities of being a good leader in my domain, being a good programmer and working as a software engineer, a backend developer, data scientist or a researcher. i can also think about starting on my own venture after graduation.

And about the threats to me, i think there is a extremely huge mass of people in VIT and standing out distinctively out of that huge mass will be a challenge for me.
